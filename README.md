# Meta-SGD PyTorch
A PyTorch implementation of Meta-SGD (https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09835). The model used to train is RetinaVVS, a biologically plausible neural network that mimics the Retina + V1 Cortex system (https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.00945).
To understand how the code works and use it yourself, please refer to the original repository this code was adapted from: https://github.com/dragen1860/MAML-Pytorch
